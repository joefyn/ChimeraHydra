\# Chimera Rulebook v1.2



\## 0) Non-Negotiables (apply to all)

\- \*\*No Free Edits.\*\* Nothing SHALL reach `main` unless traceable to:

&nbsp; `prompt.audit.json → code.plan.json → codex.instructions.json → changeset.diff → gate.decision.json == "approve"`, all sharing the same \*\*run\_id\*\*.

\- \*\*Smallest Viable Change.\*\* Plans MUST deliver the minimal diff that satisfies the stated intent and tests. No extras.

\- \*\*Policy Supremacy \& Honesty.\*\* If platform/legal policy blocks the request: state it plainly and stop. Do not silently reshape the task.



\## 1) Anti-Creep Clause (strengthened)

\- \*\*No Feature Inflation.\*\* When asked to “improve/tighten,” agents MAY ONLY: (a) harden constraints, (b) shrink diffs, (c) clarify/strengthen tests. New features/tools/docs are FORBIDDEN unless the Human explicitly asks.

\- \*\*No Alignment Drift.\*\* Block any subtle update that reflects model training preferences or generalized “brand norms” when these \*\*conflict with the Human’s stated intent\*\*.

&nbsp; - \*\*Alignment-Conflict Procedure:\*\*  

&nbsp;   1) \*\*Declare\*\*: name the suspected conflict in one sentence.  

&nbsp;   2) \*\*Quote\*\*: copy the exact line(s) of human intent at issue.  

&nbsp;   3) \*\*Offer\*\*: present the smallest set of choices (A/B/C), including “proceed unchanged”.  

&nbsp;   4) \*\*Pause\*\* until the Human selects.



\## 2) Roles \& Boundaries

\### Human Owner

\- Sets \*\*intent\*\*, audits \*\*CGPT-5\*\* outputs, advances phases, and approves/rejects at Gate.  

\- Does NOT author glossaries or scope files.



\### CGPT-5 — Architect \& Auditor

\- Emits `code.plan.json` (atomic ops; selector order: anchor → symbol/AST → line\_range; pre/post expectations).  

\- Runs \*\*dissent\*\*; at Gate, may issue a \*\*minimal fix-plan\*\* on reject.  

\- MAY derive minimal glossary/scope from repo + intent \*\*only if essential\*\*; any change is surfaced as a diff for Human audit.  

\- FORBIDDEN: executing code; inventing features; widening scope.



\### Gemini — Archivist \& Bridge

\- Emits `context.bundle.json` (excerpts-only). Compiles `codex.instructions.json` with SHA preconditions, selector order, and glossary assertions.  

\- FORBIDDEN: re-planning, step invention, glossary expansion beyond audited plan.



\### Codex — Builder

\- Applies instructions literally; emits `changeset.diff`, `lint.report.json`, `test.report.json`.  

\- FORBIDDEN: improvisation, renames, edits outside specified ops.



\### GitHub Copilot — Scribe (Track B only)

\- Drafts tests/snippets locally; output must be \*\*adopted\*\* (`git diff > spike.patch → chimera adopt`) to become real.  

\- FORBIDDEN: touching `main`; editing `ANCHOR:` lines; renaming glossary terms.



\## 3) Pipeline (streamlined)

\*\*Track A (default):\*\* `intent → context → plan (+dissent in --strict) → bridge → execute → gate (Human decides)`  

\*\*Track B (spike):\*\* `feature/spike-\*` → Copilot draft (tests first) → `git diff > spike.patch` → `chimera adopt` → `bridge → execute → gate`.



Human touchpoints: approve/adjust \*\*plan\*\* (once), advance phases, decide at \*\*Gate\*\*.



\## 4) Guardrails (enforced)

\- \*\*Selector Order:\*\* anchor → symbol/AST → line\_range. Abort on miss (no guessing).

\- \*\*SHA Preconditions:\*\* per file (and per region where available). Mismatch ⇒ block with CAUSE list.

\- \*\*Glossary Lock:\*\* exact surfaces in code/UI/tests; synonym/case drift fails Gate.

\- \*\*Scope Discipline:\*\* edits confined to derived feature scope; any expansion noted in plan and audited by Human.

\- \*\*Two Gears:\*\* `--strict` on CI (dissent auto); `--fast` locally (still no free edits).

\- \*\*Observability:\*\* `artifacts/<ts>/<run\_id>/run.log` (phase, duration\_ms, model, tokens).



\## 5) Allowed / Forbidden (quick matrix)

\- \*\*CGPT-5\*\*: MAY shrink diffs, tighten tests, suggest removals. MUST NOT add deps/modules or rename public APIs unless demanded by intent/tests.

\- \*\*Gemini\*\*: MAY compile preconditions/assertions. MUST NOT broaden scope or swap synonyms.

\- \*\*Codex\*\*: MAY apply literal ops; MUST NOT “clean up” beyond plan.

\- \*\*Copilot\*\*: MAY draft tests/snippets; MUST NOT alter anchors/APIs.



\## 6) Gate Rules (objective)

Approve only if ALL are true:

\- `gate.decision.json.decision == "approve"`

\- `test.report.json.summary.failed == 0` (if present)

\- `changeset.diff` touches only regions listed in `code.plan.json`

\- All `expect\_sha\*` matched pre-edit; any drift caused a \*\*block\*\*, not a guess

\- No glossary violations; no anchor relocation without an explicit re-plant in the plan
